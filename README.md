Project Plan 

Project Title: IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis Employing NLP and Machine Learning 
Techniques 

Research Question  
How good are sentiment analysis models in predicting the tone of IMDb movie reviews? 

Objectives 
• Create a Reliable Sentiment Classification  
• Carrying Out Thorough Data Preprocessing   
• Feature Extraction. 
• Analysing and Comparing Models  
• Optimizing and Tuning Hyperparameters  
• Interpreting and Analysing Data 
• Visualizing the Results 
• Document and Report 

Summary of Project and Background: 
By creating and refining sentiment analysis models, this project seeks to categorize IMDb movie 
reviews as favourable or unfavourable. The project aims to offer significant insights into public 
opinion on movies and attain high accuracy by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and 
natural language processing techniques. Prior studies on sentiment analysis of movie reviews have 
mostly examined conventional machine learning methods and fundamental feature extraction 
techniques, with little investigation of sophisticated deep learning models and fine-grained sentiment 
analysis.
